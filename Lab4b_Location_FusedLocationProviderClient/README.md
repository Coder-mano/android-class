# Getting user's location using Google Play Services approach - using FusedLocationProviderClient

*Note: This approach is the recommended approach and provides simpler abstraction over the native LocationListener. It also allows you to choose the battery consumption requirements and provide the best ratio between the location precision and speed VS battery life. If you want more control over the location proces use the LocationListener which is in [Lab4a](https://github.com/kkui-chi/VMIR/tree/master/Lab4a_Location_LocationListener)*

Detailed description of code will be added soon.
