WARNING ... APP HAS A KNOWN BUG.
It requests for permissions but does not call the service after the permissions are granted.
Restart the application after granting the permissions and everything will work as expected.
Use emulator to change the location - tresholds are set to 5seconds and 15 meters so the difference of old and new LAT and LON have to be at least somehow significant.
